The Projects module provides project management capabilities with stage-based tracking and milestone payments.

## Purpose

This module handles:
- Project creation and tracking
- Stage-based project breakdown
- Milestone payment management
- Progress monitoring
- Timeline tracking

## Key Concepts

### Project

Main project entity:
- **Basic info** - Name, description
- **Timeline** - Start date, end date
- **Status** - Active, Completed, On Hold, Cancelled
- **Client** - Associated counterparty

### ProjectStage

Project breakdown:
- **Name** - Stage identifier
- **Description** - What this stage covers
- **Completion** - Percentage complete
- **Order** - Sequence in project
- **Due date** - Stage deadline

### ProjectStagePayment

Milestone payments:
- **Amount** - Payment value
- **Currency** - Money currency
- **Status** - Pending, Paid, Overdue
- **Stage link** - Associated project stage
