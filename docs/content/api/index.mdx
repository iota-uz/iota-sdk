# API Reference

IOTA SDK provides both GraphQL and REST APIs for integration and custom development.

## GraphQL API

GraphQL is available for flexible data queries and mutations:

| Module | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| **Core** | `/graphql` | Users, uploads, authentication |
| **Warehouse** | `/warehouse/graphql` | Products, inventory, orders |

### GraphQL Features

- **Strongly typed** - Schema defines all available operations
- **Flexible queries** - Request exactly what you need
- **Real-time** - Subscriptions for live updates
- **Introspection** - Self-documenting API

### Making GraphQL Requests

GraphQL endpoint accepts POST requests with JSON body:

```json
{
  "query": "query { users(limit: 10) { id firstName email } }"
}
```

## REST API

REST endpoints are available for traditional HTTP operations:

### Authentication

All API requests require authentication via:
- **Session cookie** - For browser clients
- **API token** - For programmatic access (if enabled)

### Common Patterns

| Operation | Method | Pattern |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| List | GET | `/resource` |
| Get one | GET | `/resource/:id` |
| Create | POST | `/resource` |
| Update | PUT | `/resource/:id` |
| Delete | DELETE | `/resource/:id` |

## Module APIs

Select a module to view its API documentation:

- [Core API](/api/core) - Users, authentication, uploads
- [Warehouse API](/api/warehouse) - Products, inventory, orders

## API Explorer

Use the GraphQL Playground to explore the API:

1. Start the development server
2. Navigate to `/graphql` (or module-specific endpoint)
3. Use the interactive explorer to build queries

## SDK Clients

While you can use raw HTTP requests, consider:

- **Generated clients** - Use GraphQL codegen for type-safe clients
- **Apollo Client** - Feature-rich GraphQL client
- **Fetch/Axios** - Simple HTTP clients for REST

*Note: Not all modules expose GraphQL schemas. Modules without GraphQL use REST endpoints exclusively.*
